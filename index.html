            While the definition of crowdsourcing is still a matter of debate, a good place to start is the one used by author Jeff Howe, who coined the term in a 2006 Wired article. Howe defines crowdsourcing as “the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an open call.”
For many, Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia anyone can edit, remains the best everyday example of crowdsourcing in action. Other common examples include crowdsourced business reviews on Yelp and traffic alerts on Waze, or, in the local government space, 311 phone lines and mobile apps that enable residents to report potholes, broken streetlights or other problems in their neighborhoods.
